Regarding HierS data in CARLSBAD.  For scaffold promiscuity analysis, the MLP assays are used, so the MLP
compounds must be involved.  In the early development of CARLSBAD (March 2011) MLP compounds have not yet
been included, so MLP must be combined with CARLSBAD compounds prior to HierS analysis.  Many or even most
of the CARLSBAD compounds will not be present in MLP, not have CIDs, and thus not have compound,
bioactivity data, though they may well have scaffold bioactivity data.
