<B>Bioactivity knowledgebase and hypotheses via chemical patterns.</B>
<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
CarlsbadOne is a one-step, bioactivity data-mining,
evidence-driven application for biophamaceutical knowledge discovery
via cheminformatics, chemogenomics and systems pharmaco-informatics.
CARLSBAD = Confederated Annotated Research Libraries for Small molecule BioActivity Data.
This web app queries the CARLSBAD database, which consists of targets, small molecules, 
bioactivities, related data, and chemical patterns comprised of scaffolds
and MCES clusters.
<P>
The CarlsbadOne web app provids a unified portal, designed for usability and simplicity,
with useful, relevant results for scientifically meaningful queries.
Specifically, this means:
<UL>
<LI> One webapp UI for query and network viewing via CytoscapeJS.
<LI> One step, one topic query logic, with queries defined by one disease, drug, or target.
<LI> One degree of separation via chemical pattern associations to novel target/compound hypotheses.
<LI> One unified, coherent data resource.
<LI> Step One for bioactivity knowledge discovery.
</UL>
CarlsbadOne can provide an effective starting point for initial and exploratory data
analysis.  More advanced queries will require 
alternative interfaces, such as via direct SQL access to the database, or by 
migrating the relational database to a graph database platform such as Neo4j.
<P>
<H3>Query logic</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>disease-query mode</B>
<DD>A single disease is the query.  Diseases are from KEGG.  KEGG also reports linked genes,
which reference proteins via NCBI_GI and Uniprot IDs, and thereby CARLSBAD targets.
The one-click network includes those targets, active compounds, their scaffolds, and neighbor compounds.
<DT><B>drug-query mode</B>
<DD>A single drug is the query.  All targets for which the drug is active are included in the retrieved
subnet.  In addition, targets are included for which the active compounds are associated with the drug query
via chemical patterns.
<DT><B>target-query mode</B>
<DD>A single protein target is the query.  All active compounds are included in the retrieved subnet.
In addition, compounds are included which are associated with the active compounds via chemical patterns.
</DL>
<H3>Relationship to Query (R2Q):</H3>
Targets and compounds found each have a relationship to the query, and in Carlsbad these
relationships are either:
<UL>
<LI><B>Empirical</B> - related via empirical activity data.
<LI><B>Hypothesis</B> - related via scaffold <I>and</I> empirical data.
</UL>
Relationships generally also vary in network distance.  However, in CarlsbadOne, 
to be regarded as empirical, entities must be associated by only ONE link of each type
(e.g. target&rarr;compound&rarr;target).
<H3>Filters:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Minimum scaffold weight: Scaffold-compound associations are weighted based on an approximation of the 
fraction of compound heavy atoms which are in the scaffold.  Lower weights are thus correlated with weaker
associations of less significance.  Currently, this filter affects both the known active compounds and
scaffold-associated unknowns.
</UL>
<H3>Reduced-graph representations:</H3>
To facilitate effective visualization of large networks, reduced-graph representations are
available:
<OL>
<LI><B>Targets-only</B>: target-target edges represent shared compounds.
Activity profile information is reflected via visual cues (e.g. target-node size).
<LI><B>Targets-and-scaffolds</B>: compounds are hidden and represented via their scaffolds. Target-target edges
representing shared compounds included.
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Scaffolds and MCES</H3>
Carlsbad includes two types of chemical patterns, (1) <B>scaffolds</B>, and (2) <B>maximum-common-edge-subgraphs (MCES)</B>, each defined by rigorous
published cheminformatics algorithms. In the CarlsbadOne app, these are referred to generically as scaffolds, though previously
we used the less familiar term <B>common chemical pattern (CCP)</B>.
